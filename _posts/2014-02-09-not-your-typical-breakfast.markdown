We arrived in Mumbai around 3am this morning after having traveled for roughly 19.5 hours, but the journey wasn't over yet. The next 2 hours were spent getting through immigration and retrieving our 6 heaping luggage bags, each packed right up to the 50 lb limit allowed by the airline. The trip continued still for another 5 hour drive from Mumbai to reach our final destination of Surat.

An hour out from town, we decided to take a quick break for some breakfast. My cousin recommended this little gem called Sugar 'n Spice.

I was starving at this point so I didn't waste any time in ordering. Here's what I had:

**Tomato Onion Uttapam** - a savory rice pancake that is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and served with sambar, a spicy daal soup.
